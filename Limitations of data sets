Census data :

-Many different sources which could have a variety of definitions for each term and vary in terms of referencing periods.
-Some data is based on complete enumerations whilst others rely on sampling. The results can vary from very precise to “informed guesses”.

Funding Data:
Not specified where the funding goes to exactly, i.e. for police funding that money could go into racial sensibility or de escalation training for officers which could help reduce police brutality, or it simply goes into funding more police officers / more advanced weapons etc. 
In our analysis, as we put the per capita police funding in relation to the per capita ‘social funding’, we potentially overlook significant differences between states due to different amounts of funding. 
Not specified whether the funding is adjusted for inflation - could change the outcome of the results
