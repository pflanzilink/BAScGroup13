In order to evaluate and use our research results appropriately, it is important to recognise the limitations and potential shortcomings of our research question, datasets, methodology and analysis. 

Research question: One aim of our project was to investigate the policy change that the Black Lives Matter movement demands: To reallocate funding that states are giving to the police to social services, such as public welfare and education. As students who personally sympathise strongly with the movement’s cause, we often struggled not to have our bias impact our methodology. While we are confident to have ruled out our biases, we cannot be entirely sure.

Datasets:
Census demographics data: Various sources and methodologies compile the demographic figures, e.g. some rely on precise enumerations and others on ‘informed guesses’.
Fatal encounters: Potentially different definitions for race than the Census dataset. Fatal encounters cover only one aspect of police brutality, despite being the easiest to ‘measure’ numerically. Furthermore, it is not a comprehensive or ‘complete’ dataset, as often the race was unspecified and many cases might not have been reported so they are not included.
Funding data: Unfortunately, the definition, i.e. the specific expenditures for each category are not given, which limits our analysis. In our analysis, as we put the per capita police funding in relation to the per capita ‘social funding’, we potentially overlook significant differences between states due to different amounts of funding. 

Methodology:
?? Maybe mention here that we used only proportional police funding? Also that we only look at a few selected variables. Also that the time period is probably too short to make informed conclusions.
